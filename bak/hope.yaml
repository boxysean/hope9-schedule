talks:
  - title: "3D Printing: Making Friends in DC Before People Start Freaking Out"
    speakers: Michael Weinberg
    desc: "This talk is about protecting 3D printing from industries that are not excited about disruption. It will begin with an overview of the technology behind 3D printing and how the industry is developing and diversifying. It will then cover how intellectual property (IP) relates to 3D printing, and highlight the opportunities that 3D printing gives us to rethink the permission culture that has developed alongside the growth of digital copyright. The talk will end with a description of current IP conflicts connected to 3D printing and examples of steps being taken today to win allies among policymakers in Washington, DC. 3D printing has the possibility of being a widely disruptive and beneficial technology, and the last 15 years have taught us that not everyone embraces widespread disruption. It is possible that industries disrupted by 3D printing will react along the lines of those disrupted by the Internet (negatively). Fortunately, today we have the opportunity to consider what could have been done in the early days of the Internet to insulate it from some of the legal and policy attacks in DC. HOPE attendees and the hacker community at large will benefit from beginning to think through these issues today - before a problem occurs."
  
  - title: "Activist DDoS Attacks: When Analogies and Metaphors Fail"
    speakers: Molly Sauter
    desc: "What are we talking about when we refer to activist Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks? Digital sit-ins? Juvenile bullying and censorship? Something completely different? The rhetorical framings by both advocates and critics of activist DDoS attacks have ultimately fallen short of successfully defining DDoS as an activist tactic. Metaphoric characterizations have failed to describe the reality of activist DDoS attacks, and new analysis is needed if we are to fully understand the tactic's potential. In an effort to come to this new analytical understanding, this talk examines the history of DDoS attacks in activism in general, culminating with the case study of the Anonymous Operation Payback attacks. The discussion will show how the population participating in DDoS attacks has shifted from a professionalized activist core and their peers (such as those participants in the Electronic Disturbance Theater's actions in the 1990s and 2000s) to the diffuse, less professionalized, and less conventionally politically active population that participated in the Anonymous actions. The role the media has played in past activist DDoS actions will also be explored. Evidence will be presented to show that DDoS attacks have shifted in their tactical nature from electronic direct action to a form of media manipulation."
  
  - title: "Advanced Handcuff Hacking"
    speakers: Ray
    desc: "Handcuffs always have been a special kind of challenge to lockpickers. This talk will cover advanced manipulation techniques including improvised tools, hidden and 3D-printed keys, and exploiting design weaknesses of various handcuff models. Also, the newest handcuffs produced in the United States and Europe will be shown and explained, some of which haven't even been introduced to police forces yet."
  
  - title: "Advancements in Botnet Attacks and Malware Distribution"
    speakers: Aditya K. Sood, Rohit Bansal
    desc: "Third Generation Botnets (TGBs) have circumvented the normal stature of the World Wide Web. These botnets harness the power of the HTTP communication model to complete their stealthy operations. To automate the exploit distribution mechanism for infecting users on a large scale, TGBs are collaborating with Browser Exploit Packs (BEPs). TGBs include Zeus, SpyEye, and the present-day botnet ICEX that are explicitly using BEPs such as BlackHole and Phoenix for insidious infections. Several cases of large scale infections have been seen in the recent past. Additionally, TGBs are designed with sophisticated attack techniques such as form grabbing, Ruskill, web injects (WI), web fakes (WF), DNS tampering, and other custom plug-ins to steal information. These attack techniques are heavily relied upon in the Man in the Browser (MitB) paradigm. The infection strategies include programs such as spreaders that infect other software to conduct drive-by-download/drive-by-cache attacks. This talk delves deep into the design of present-day malware andration for the wiring of your brain, now called an Autism Spectrum Disorder (it used to be called Asperger's Syndrome). At HOPE, we're the majority; neurotypicals are the rest of the world that do not understand us and may even be afraid of us. Most on the spectrum are male, but there are a lot of females flying under the radar. This panel will discuss the spectrum and how we fit on it, and how we interact with the world at large."
  
  - title: "Brain Chemistry: How Psychoactive Chemicals Hack the Central Nervous System"
    speakers: Jennifer Ortiz
    desc: "People have been using chemistry to hack their bodies and their brains since antiquity. In the past several decades, we have come to understand much more about the processes involved. How is it that certain molecules cause profound alterations in perception? How do they alleviate physical and psychological pain? How do they get people high? Why are some drugs psychoactive and not others? Why are some toxic? This presentation explores the answers to these questions and more."
  
  - title: "Building Radios to Talk to the Dead"
    speakers: Wil Lindsay
    desc: "Apophenia is the human ability to perceive patterns and meaning in completely random data sets. The effect is often explored by \"ghost hunters\" who use electronic tools to find patterns in the environment around us and exploit them as a way to communicate with spirits of the deceased. This discussion will cover the radio-based and electromagnetic technology commonly used for the reception of EVP or \"Electronic Voice Phenomena.\" These devices are often modified radios or home constructed circuits which follow a mixture of basic engineering, empirical results, metaphysical concepts, and, in some cases, pure hucksterism. This talk will look at several of these devices, their underlying circuits, their design philosophy, and the culture that surrounds them."
  
  - title: "Cell Site Location Data and Nontrespassory Surveillance after U.S. v. Jones"
    speakers: Hanni Fakhoury
    desc: "With the rise of smartphones, the government's use of cell site location data to pinpoint our exact location has grown more widespread (and precise) over time. For years, courts permitted the government to get this location data without a search warrant. And judges that fought against the government's attempts at getting this data were met with an unfortunate reality of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence: we don't have any privacy in data we turn over to third parties, like cell phone providers. The U.S. Supreme Court's recent decision in U.S. v. Jones however, presented a \"sea change\" in the law of warrantless surveillance, calling into question the future viability of the third party doctrine. This talk will review the law of location data, go in depth into how Jones calls this law into question, and conclude with the steps we need to take in the future in order to safeguard our privacy."
  
  - title: "Closing Ceremonies"
    desc: "Don't even think of leaving early on Sunday. This is where you get to celebrate the end of another HOPE conference and start looking forward to and planning the next one. (Maybe we'll even tell you what the next one will be called if you stick around.) You'll also hear a lot of the story behind what it took to put this event together. Oh yes, and did we mention that we give away prizes during this final gathering? Well, we do, and they're awesome. You now have all of the reasons you need to stay into the evening on Sunday and get the most out of HOPE. Monday will wait."
  
  - title: "Combat Robots Then and Now"
    speakers: David Calkins, Simone Davalos
    desc: "Fighting robots have been around since the first gearhead figured out that it was really fun to smash thousands of dollars worth of metal and electronics together in the name of sport. This talk will cover the brief but intense history of combat robotics, how the technology has evolved, where it's going, and where combat robots happen around the world. This presentation will include video, backstage photos, and insights from the organizers of the only large scale combat robot shows left in the United States: RoboGames and The ComBots Cup."
  
  - title: "Community Fabrication: Four Years Later"
    speakers: Far McKon
    desc: "One hacker's view of the last four years in 3D printing and the expansion of DIY culture. It will cover the state of the art then, the state of the art now, and where we imagine we will be in four years. Far will review what technologies succeeded, what failed, and how 3D printing has grown, warts and all. He'll also talk about the growth of hackerspaces in that time and how the changes in these topics tie together to show the growing pains of both hacker-centric movements. He'll also make another round of predictions and discuss where 3D printing and hackerspaces are going next."
  
  - title: "Computer Forensics: Possibility, Probability, Opinion, and Fact"
    speakers: Joe Cicero
    desc: "How easy is it to end up with illegal content on your computer? How expensive is it to prove you didn't know about it? What is it like for someone who is arrested for a computer crime? How long do these cases go on for? What does the prosecution provide your attorney and forensic examiner with? This presentation will cover these questions and more, based on experiences as a defense forensic expert."
  
  - title: "Consciousness Hacking: Leveraging Science and Technology to Engineer Enlightenment"
    speakers: Mikey Siegel
    desc: "The brain, mind, and ultimately our underlying sense of purpose and well being are the ultimate hacking frontier. But our efforts are more often than not focused on changing our external world to suit some need or desire. What if we flipped that, and focused on transforming our own subjective experience? It's not a new idea - humans have been hacking consciousness for millennia with tools like meditation, breathing, dance, music, ceremony... the list is long. All of these are forms of technology evolved over thousands of years by scientists relentlessly studying the fundamental nature of direct experience. Why? Because human suffering can be eradicated, from the inside out. It's this crowd, not a yogi in a cave, that has the skills and motivation to create modern tools that fundamentally transform our reality. This talk will review the wild and wide open world of consciousness hacking, and show you how to get started."
  
  - title: "Countermeasures: Proactive Self Defense Against Ubiquitous Surveillance"
    speakers: Lisa Shay, Greg Conti
    desc: "From governments fighting terrorists to companies hawking products to free online services where you are the product, it seems that everyone wants a piece of you and your personal information. This talk begins with the current state of our surveillance society and delves deeply into countermeasures you and society at large can employ to maintain and protect your right to privacy. Lisa and Greg will deconstruct a surveillance system and examine techniques for defeating or degrading each component. They'll cover technical countermeasures, but also present techniques for influencing policy, law, and the incentives underpinning surveillance activities. Left unconstrained, the problems of the emerging surveillance society will only get worse as more and more sensors and tracking applications invade the physical and digital worlds. You'll leave this talk with a clear understanding of how to protect yourself and with strategies to deflect the trajectory of our surveilled future."
  
  - title: "Crimeware Tools and Techniques of 2012: Past, Present, and Future"
    speakers: Alexander Heid
    desc: "Much has evolved in the brief 24 months that have passed since the last presentation on this topic, which included a comprehensive overview of the Zeus and SpyEye trojans, popular exploits being used in the wild, and cash out methodologies of the digital crime actors at the time. Today, new digital currencies have emerged, vulnerabilities in popular crimeware kits have been made public, black market credit card trades have become automated, popular crime forums have been hacked and dumped, and the industry based around digital crime analysis and counterintelligence has grown exponentially. In spite of recent arrests of a few individuals, malicious actors are still numerous and able to keep ahead of the law by adapting to the changing environment and hardening their operations. This presentation will go over these developments, as well as the latest digital crime tools, techniques, and methodologies that are currently in use during the present day. The talk will also assess where the current trends will be heading in the future."
  
  - title: "Cryptome Tracks the NYPD Ring of Steel"
    speakers: Deborah Natsios, John Young
    desc: "Cryptome's digital multimedia presentation of original cartography, animations, video, and architectural documentation will explore the urban implications of the NYPD One Police Plaza Security Plan - a.k.a. Ring of Steel - which locked down Lower Manhattan after 9/11, transforming its Civic Center into a threatscape centered on NYPD headquarters. With its militarized jurisdiction mobilizing through technologies of command, control, communications, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, the Ring of Steel has declared itself an iconic public space for our time."
  
  - title: "DARPA Funding for Hackers, Hackerspaces, and Education: A Good Thing?"
    speakers: Mitch Altman, Psytek, Willow Brugh, Fiacre O'Duinn, Matt Joyce
    desc: "Mitch Altman caused a stir this spring when he publicly announced that he would not be helping U.S. Maker Faires this year, after it was publicly announced that they received funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). So, what's the controversy? DARPA, an agency of the U.S. military, has funded many famous projects over the past several decades, including GPS and the Internet. People in DARPA are now making large amounts of grant funding available for hackers and hackerspaces to do projects of their choice, as well as funding for education through hands-on learning, which MAKE Magazine is using to help schools. Does it matter that DARPA is responsible for the development of new technology for the U.S. military with an annual budget of $3.2 billion? What are the ethics of using funds from people or organizations that may or may not be aligned with one's own goals? What are the ramifications for the hacker/maker movement? Is DARPA funding overall a good thing? There is no simple answer. Explore the ethics and ramifications with Mitch, as moderator, and the panelists, as they give their perspectives on this complex set of issues."
  
  - title: "Dead in a Pool of Blood and Millions of Dollars of Net Art"
    speakers: Jeremiah Johnson (Nullsleep), Don Miller (NO CARRIER)
    desc: "0-Day Art is a warez group for art, focusing primarily on digitally represented works. The project was born in response to situations where takedown notices, pay walls, and practices of \"taking it offline\" threaten the distribution and availability of art online. 0-Day Art seeks to put net art back on the net. Using BitTorrent to package and distribute \"art warez\" within 24 hours of its initial availability, whenever possible, and social networks to quickly spread the word, the project has received attention from Today and Tomorrow, The Verge, GalleristNY, and ArtInfo, who referred to the project as, \"the free-data pirates of the new media world.\" This is just the start. 0-Day Art exists at the intersection of art critique, hacktivism, and open culture, and manifests itself in many different ways. This talk will cover the history of 0-Day Art, as well as a brief history of \"The Scene\" (warez, demo, and art). Past projects, current projects and challenges, and the future of 0-Day Art will be discussed."
  
  - title: "Declassifying Government and Undermining a Culture of Insecurity"
    speakers: Ivan Greenberg
    desc: "It is critically important to obtain and publicize declassified government intelligence documents in order to demystify official narratives of domestic security. Over the last decade, Ivan received about 60 FBI files by using the Freedom of Information Act and by initiating a lawsuit, while writing two books on civil liberties and surveillance. He will discuss his experiences getting government documents and show how new information about surveillance practices can help the American people make better informed judgments about how surveillance systems are developed and deployed. Is it possible for popular democratic participation in the operation of surveillance systems? Whose security is really at stake? How can we counter the creation of a top-down, official \"culture of insecurity?\""
  
  - title: "Designing Free Hardware: Scratching Your Own Itch with a Soldering Iron"
    speakers: Matthew O'Gorman, Tim Heath
    desc: "So you have played with free and open source software? Time for things to get real. Learn how to go from a simple idea like \"I need some electronic dice\" or \"wouldn't it be insanely great if I could control my TV from my phone\" to a simple breadboard prototype, on to a custom schematic and then laid out in PCB, sending your Gerber files to China for fabrication, and then carefully soldering it together to scream \"it's alive\" as your LED glows brightly for the first time."
  
  - title: "Destroying Evidence Before It's Evidence"
    speakers: Hanni Fakhoury
    desc: "Covering your tracks out of fear of getting caught with your hands in the digital cookie jar can sometimes get you in more trouble than whatever crime the feds think you may have committed in the first place. This presentation identifies three specific scenarios where the act of trying to cover your digital footprints - oftentimes in innocuous and legal ways - can get you into trouble: the nebulous crime of \"anticipatory obstruction of justice,\" which can cover something as mundane as deleting an email before you're even suspected of committing (let alone charged with) a crime; the ever-expanding Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which has been stretched to cover things that are neither fraudulent nor abusive; and the potential problems with encryption. The presentation will conclude with some ways you can protect yourself that can help minimize claims that you obstructed justice."
  
  - title: "Digital Security in Health Care Institutions"
    speakers: Jorge Cortell, Alvaro Gonzalez
    desc: "Health care institutions usually have a large number of digital devices, networks, and databases. Lots of data goes through them, but are you aware of how much data that is? And how secure is it? How easily can this data be captured? How easy is it to access those medical devices? Can this be done without being detected? After six years of involvement in health care IT projects, Jorge and Alvaro have some stories and details to share."
  
  - title: "DKIM: You're Doing It Wrong"
    speakers: Quincy Robertson
    desc: "DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is the most effective, widely deployed email forgery countermeasure available today... if implemented correctly. Many of the world's largest and most trusted companies, including some of those driving the standard, have fatally flawed deployments. When the first standard for SMTP was published in 1982, the Internet was a much smaller and safer place. Ever since the first spammers, we've been trying to fix email with various hacks such as callout verification, forward confirmed reverse DNS, PGP, S/MIME, SPF, Sender ID, DomainKeys, DKIM, and an ever-changing collection of filters. All of them have serious flaws. This talk will cover several common mistakes made when deploying DKIM and how they can be exploited to achieve the holy grail of email forgery."
  
  - title: "DUI/DWI Testing - A Hacker's View of the Technology and Process Behind the BAC and Standard Field Sobriety Test"
    speakers: WJ, Alex Muentz
    desc: "This talk will look behind the process, techniques, and technology (or lack thereof) used by law enforcement to identify suspected intoxication. What most people don't know is that there is little in the way of scientific process or technology that is used during the testing of intoxication. The process relies on a strategy of behavioral cues and coercion often geared towards leading an individual to admit wrongdoing. The technology and instruments used by law enforcement for determining sobriety has changed little over the years. Some of these technologies are inherently flawed or misleading. This presentation will take a closer look at the most common techniques and equipment including the Breathalyzer, Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN), and the instruction led Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST). There will be a discussion of how each of these processes works and an enumeration of potential flaws or tactics one should be aware of to ensure fair and unbiased treatment."
  
  - title: "Electric Bodies and Possible Worlds"
    speakers: Jaime Magiera, Micha Cardenas, Cayden Mak
    desc: "Though there are many expensive, mainstream solutions for wearable computing, augmented/virtual reality, and alternate reality gaming, there is also a burgeoning community of DIY projects in these areas that focus on self-expression, empowerment, and community building. This panel will provide an overview of several important projects for wearable computing, augmented/virtual reality, and alternate reality gaming. In particular, the session will relate how these projects allow individuals to explore the many possible worlds and identities available to us.  Saturday 1630 Sassaman (90 minutes)"
  
  - title: "The Emergence of Hacker as Artist and Artist as Hacker"
    speakers: Andrew Cameron Zahn, Katherine Bennett, William Cromar, Chris Thompson
    desc: "The new direction and emergence of hackers working like artists and artists working like hackers brings up a wealth of questions pertaining to these new mediums. How do the practices of \"hackers\" differ, if at all, from those of \"artists?\" Should we question when or how a hacker project falls between the lines of art, design, or hacking? The panel will discuss how their work bridges the gap between hacking, new media, and art. Their skills and interests vary quite a lot, but they all use technology to make a statement."
  
  - title: "Exploiting ZigBee and the Internet of Things"
    speakers: Travis Goodspeed
    desc: "Now that ZigBee is finally appearing in the wild, Travis will take a look back at all the nifty ways of exploiting it. (ZigBee is a low cost, low power, wireless mesh network standard.) This fast-paced lecture features as many practical, real-world exploits as can fit in the time slot. Learn how to extract firmware from a locked Freescale MC13224 by grounding pin 133, how to extract keys from a Chipcon CC2530 by erasing it first, and how to hijack control of other radios with a few hypodermic syringes. You'll also learn how Certicom's proprietary crypto library caused multiple ZigBee Smart Energy Profile stacks to remotely expose private ECC keys and why none of this matters because cleartext traffic is easily found in most major cities."
  
  - title: "Explosive Steganography"
    speakers: Eric Davisson aka XlogicX
    desc: "Encryption makes information secret, steganography hides the information in plain sight. We fancy hiding it in a \"pile\" that most people would avoid. This talk explores hiding steganography in mediums such as archive exploders, file carving exploders, and virus files. There will be a release of the open source tools eZIPlode/asour, magicbomb/-asour and hivasour/hivsneeze."
  
  - title: "Film Screening: Monochrom's Kiki and Bubu: Rated R Us"
    speakers: 
    desc: "Our favorite sock puppets Kiki and Bubu have some feelings, so they sign up for an online dating site. When the People of China want to become their friend, they are excited. However, sending the People of China a video of themselves proves to be difficult: Their content gets flagged as inappropriate and taken down from YouTube. On the long quest for knowledge which follows, Kiki and Bubu learn all about Internet censorship. And love."
  
  - title: "Geeks and Depression"
    speakers: Robin DeBates, Mitch Altman, Meredith L. Patterson, Jimmie Rodgers, Daravinne
    desc: "Many of us in the geek community suffer greatly from serious depression. Enough so that several notable hackers have committed suicide over the past couple of years, including the 22-year-old co-founder of Diaspora. Moderated by Robin, a professional geek therapist, the panelists in this session will share their personal histories with depression in hopes of showing that none of us in the geek world need to be isolated with our feelings of being alone, depressed, or suicidal. Is it OK to talk about depression and suicide in the hacker community? This panel thinks it is important to make it so. Saturday 1500 Sassaman (90 minutes)"
  
  - title: "Hackers and Media Hype or Big Hacks That Never Really Happened"
    speakers: Space Rogue
    desc: "Media will often report \"hacks\" that either never actually happened or have extremely flimsy evidence. They then become major news stories through media hype while the reality is seldom reported at the same level. This talk will closely examine several instances of such stories and compare the hype with the reality. Examples will include Kevin Mitnick's compromise of NORAD, the use of steganography by Al Qaeda, the electrical blackout in Brazil, the failure of a water pump in Illinois, and others. Close attention will be paid to the media's role in presenting these stories and how they morphed from purely circumstantial to quoted facts. The structure of a hyped story will be examined so that it can be easily identified and methods of combating the hype will be discussed."
  
  - title: "Hacking Mindsets: Conceptual Approaches to Transmission Art, Improvisation, Circuitbending, and Gaming Technology"
    speakers: Tamara Yadao, Nicole Carroll, Joshua Kopstein
    desc: "In Richard Stallman's \"On Hacking\" from 2000, he addresses the stigma attached to the notion of \"hacker,\" while clarifying the act of hacking as a creative mindset that encourages playful/clever exploration of established cultural forms, from eating utensils to practical jokes, as opposed to methods for security breach. Beyond the more obvious examples of hacking, Stallman applies this mindset to two specific music compositions: \"Ma Fin Est Mon Commencement\" by 14th century French composer Guillaume de Machaut and \"4'33\" by 20th century American avant-garde composer John Cage. The former is a palindromic music composition important to the development of polyphonic music and the latter is a composition written without musical notes. By referring to these two innovations as hacks more then music compositions, Stallman makes a cultural connection between hackers and artists - that hacking is innately creative.
  This presentation/demonstration will examine the notion of hacking and its connections to composer John Cage, music improvisation, and re-purposed instrumentation including radios and transmitters as instruments, circuitbent instruments, and the DIY aspect of software and hardware instruments in the demo and chip music scenes."
  
  - title: "Hacking the Cosmos via Crowdsourced Particle Astronomy"
    speakers: Ray H. O'Neal, Jr.
    desc: "The Cosmic Cube is a proposed \"desktop\" astroparticle or cosmic ray detector enabling ad-hoc formation of cosmic ray telescopes between cube operators. The speaker will address the use of peer to peer networks of detectors for investigating the nature of the flux of high energy cosmic rays and how the random nature of detection events might also be applied to information security."
  
  - title: "Hacking the Spaces"
    speakers: Johannes Grenzfurthner, Sean Bonner
    desc: "In 2009, Johannes and Frank Apunkt Schneider published their critical pamphlet \"Hacking the Spaces,\" causing a shitstorm in forums and mailing lists. The publication of the text on Boing Boing was even called a \"PR disaster for the hackerspaces movement\" by various members of the scene. Three years later, the discussion is still raging. Are hackerspaces the inclusionist paradises that their members want them to be, or are they just white middle-class boys' clubs generating nothing more than a few more streamlined members of \"Generation Self-Exploitation?\" This talk is an invitation to look at the debate and analyze its potential and drama. We promise dramatic potential and the potentially dramatic!"
  
  - title: "Hack the Law"
    speakers: Brendan O'Connor
    desc: "Recent bills such as ACTA, COICA, and SOPA in legislatures worldwide demonstrate that there exists a fundamental disconnect between hackers and politicians. Worse, the people charged with dealing with law on the ground, the lawyers, rarely have any significant technical background obtained within the last few decades. This must change. It's all well and good to write your congressperson or donate to the EFF, but it's not enough; we need hackers to go to law school. Lawyers - whether they work as attorneys, or bring their knowledge of the law back to other fields - are uniquely situated to effect direct change on politics, social issues, and the law on the ground (where they arrest poor hackers) and, unlike many fields, it's not enough to be self-taught. This presentation will focus on the utility of the hacking ethos within the law, as well as the \"law school experience,\" technical bits about actually getting in, and how to keep yourself from going nuts while spending three years surrounded by those who can't tell their megabytes from their overbites (and are terrified by Wireshark, let alone the more subtle tools in existence). Expect stories, humorous anecdotes, and terrifying lapses in judgment."
  
  - title: "Hacktivism, Tools, and the Arab Spring"
    speakers: Peter Fein, Meredith L. Patterson, The Doctor
    desc: "During the Arab Spring of 2011, agents of Telecomix, members of Anonymous, and a multitude of independent hackers took direct action to aid dissidents by helping to circumvent censorship, disseminating photographs and video footage of violence against peaceful protesters, redeploying dialup modem pools, and using DNS hijacking to warn people of online surveillance. During this time, some interesting discoveries were made by Telecomix, namely, man in the middle attacks with forged SSL certificates and the installation of deep packet inspection hardware in the networks of a number of Syrian ISPs for the purpose of Internet censorship. The activists used logs from Blue Coat web gateway devices to reverse engineer the rulesets Syrian authorities were using, so as to better advise protesters on methods of evasion. Telecomix was also instrumental in tracing where the Blue Coat DPI devices were sourced from and how they were delivered to Syria in violation of United States export regulations. The presenters (all agents of Telecomix) were among those active during the Arab Spring, and will discuss what surveillance measures they encountered, some of the threats against protesters in Syria and Egypt, and how strategies for supporting protesters evolved in response to the changing situation on the ground."
  
  - title: "HIDIOUS Methods of Keystroke Injection"
    speakers: JP Dunning
    desc: "It's amazing what can be accomplished with just a few keystrokes. Changing user passwords, formatting disks, and scanning a network are each one command away in most modern operating systems. What if you had two minutes of access on a system? Is this enough time to accomplish information gathering or exploitation on even the most hardened system? It just might be. Through a combination of software and hardware, hundreds of keystrokes a minute can be flawlessly injected into any computer to gain control of system resources. The HIDIOUS (HID Injection Over USB Suite) allows for easy configuration of keyboard/mouse injection attacks through USB."
  
  - title: "Historic Hacks in Portable Computing"
    speakers: Bill Degnan, Evan Koblentz
    desc: "\"Portable\" computing began with handheld calculating aides such as the abacus and slide rule, continued in the 1950s with mainframes mounted inside Army trucks, and emerged in suitcases, briefcases, and even pockets in the 1970s. All throughout this rich history, there were clever, funny, and security-themed hacks involved. In some cases, there were hacks needed just to construct the systems, and in others there were hacks in system usage. This talk will explain a dozen examples from which modern hackers can learn."
  
  - title: "Hosting irc.2600.net - My Life with the Thrill Kill Cult"
    speakers: Andrew Strutt aka r0d3nt
    desc: "An overview of the history of 2600net for at least the last ten years. This talk will cover 2600net infrastructure and policies, why it is the way it is, along with how to communicate securely and build trust with users and friends. Who are the hosts and operators? Meet the crew! What other communities are around 2600 and the IRC network? How can you get involved? Special attention will be given to DDoSes, LulzSec, Anonymous, th3j35t3r syndrome, and all sorts of other challenges. Expect other staffers and channel operators to stop in for this talk."
  
  - title: "How to Communicate with Your Car's Network"
    speakers: Robert Leale
    desc: "Modern vehicles are essentially mobile computers and controller networks. On average, there are around ten embedded controllers in a vehicle. These controllers are responsible for running the engine, locking and unlocking the vehicle, sounding the horn, and much, much more. These networks are very different from current computer networks. This talk will help you understand how to get started, what information is on the vehicle network, and how you can use this data to get information from and send commands to these controllers. Additionally, this talk will list the current tools available for communicating with vehicles and how to interpret the communications between the controllers."
  
  - title: "How to Retrofit the First Law of Robotics"
    speakers: Eben Moglen
    desc: "We live with robots now, as we always knew we would. But they have no hands or feet. We carry them in our pockets. They see what we see. They hear what we hear. They always know where we are. But they do not work for us, and they are not programmed to obey the First Law. Profit made them, profit runs them, and they hurt us every day. Free Software can retrofit the First Law of Robotics into the robots we call cell phones, but those who control the robots don't want freedom inside. That's where we come in. This talk will discuss how."
  
  - title: "ICANN's New gTLD Program: Implications on Security, Stability, and Governance"
    speakers: Alexander Urbelis
    desc: "The Internet is about to rapidly expand. Through ICANN's new generic top level domain (gTLD) program - for the first time ever - individual entities can customize the space to the right of the dot. While currently only 22 gTLDs exist (e.g., .com, .net, .org, etc.), on June 13, ICANN announced that it had received an unexpected 1,930 applications for new gTLDs, ranging from applications for .AARP to .ZULU. This talk will examine the security and stability concerns that arise from the rapid expansion of the Internet's root zone. Also included will be the current state of the new gTLD program, the security issues that plagued the application process in April, and how this new model of gTLD ownership (with large swaths of Internet real estate in the hands of private entities) will change our current model of Internet governance."
  
  - title: "I'm Not a Real Friend, But I Play One on the Internet"
    speakers: Tim Hwang
    desc: "This talk examines the topic of socialbots - realistic, automated bot identities online that are optimized to reliably elicit certain types of social behaviors in groups of users on platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Deployed en masse, large swarms of these bots are able to subtly (and not-so-subtly) shape the ways in which communities grow, connect, and behave on these platforms. Insofar as people increasingly come to rely on these networks into the future, the bots hold the promise (and threat) of shaping not only the social universe of opinions and influence, but real world coordination and action among people as well. Ultimately, this talk will conclude by discussing how these bots suggest the evolution of classic social engineering into a broader social hacking - which approaches human networks as if they were computer networks and applies similar principles for their compromise and defense against the social influence of third parties."
  
  - title: "Information Distribution in the Arab Spring - No Hacks Required"
    speakers: Griffin Boyce
    desc: "From pirate radio, livestreaming, and video-sharing apps, to asynchronous mesh networks, Bluetooth, SMS/MMS, i2p, and Tor hidden services, the ways that activists in the Middle East and North Africa get critical information out are far more varied than most people know. With so much attention given to leaks recently, it's easy to perceive the \"liberation\" of information as involving major hacks of critical systems. But reality is, as always, much more complex and interesting. This talk will show just how distribution channels in the Middle East are created and maintained, and the positive impacts they can have."
  
  - title: "Infrastructure Mediated Sensing of Whole-Home Human Activity"
    speakers: John McNabb
    desc: "Devices are being developed to monitor what you do in your home. Even without Orwell's telescreen (which is under development), there is a lot of information that can be collected about your Activities of Daily Life. The beneficial goals of these devices include promoting positive things like water conservation, helping people improve their personal health, and monitoring people in assisted living environments. This talk will describe the technology of the devices used to collect and transmit this data, and discuss some of the social, ethical, political, economic, privacy, and legal issues raised. What could go wrong? Could these systems be used by governments to micromanage personal behavior? Could employers use these systems to regulate employees' off-duty behavior? Could such data be used to convict people in court? Could this data be stolen, abused, or falsified? The answer for each of these questions is \"yes.\""
  
  - title: "The Internet is for Porn! How High Heels and Fishnet Have Driven Internet Innovation and Information Security"
    speakers: Chris Kubecka
    desc: "A dark and seedy journey to explain the real driver behind Internet innovation: porn. How an economy built on the ultimate satisfaction just a click away has driven technological advances. Racy browsing habits involving our innermost secrets, vulnerable parties, and criminal syndicates have driven malicious code and subsequent security advances. Broad ranging censorship involving much more than pornography has been the end result in attempts to reign in such \"unhealthy\" habits by well-intentioned governments and organizations. This talk will include a timeline of pornography on the Internet, related security threats, an overview of industry economics (legal and ~illegal), and related censorship. Audience discussion and participation is welcome, but please, no BYOP."
  
  - title: "IPv6 Now! What Does This Mean?"
    speakers: Joe Klein
    desc: "On June 6th, World IPv6 Launch Day occurred, another step in the replacement of the aging IPv4 Internet. Adoption of IPv6 as of June 17th is 6.9 percent in Romania, 4.5 percent in France, 1.4 percent in Japan, 1 percent in the United States, 0.58 percent in China, and 0.28 percent in Russia. This is up from less than 0.006 percent within the past two years. This presentation will answer the questions: \"What is the risk of adopting IPv6?\", \"What is the risk of not adopting IPv6?\", and \"What are the new opportunities for hackers?\""

  - title: "\"Kill The Internet\""
    speakers: MemeFactory (Mike Rugnetta, Stephen Bruckert, Patrick Davison)
    desc: "As grassroots Internet culture grows and flourishes, pushing out into international mainstream recognition, top-down cultural models are threatened and fight back, while governments attempt to quash and chill dissent empowered and organized by the Internet. How are people from the Internet fighting back? What does that even mean? And will it be enough?
  MemeFactory is three guys that give tightly rehearsed performative lectures about Internet culture. Their talks document, explore, and critique the emerging culture of the Internet in a visually-focused, fast-paced style that mimics the experience of having ten browser windows open while talking on the phone and watching a YouTube video."
  
  - title: "Legal Processes As Infrastructure Attacks"
    speakers: Alex Muentz
    desc: "Law enforcement and lawmakers have been showing much more of an interest in regulating the Internet. The hacker community needs to understand how certain legal methods work like IT infrastructure attacks. This talk will explain legal processes such as subpoenas, search warrants, and e-discovery as IT infrastructure attacks, as well as how to talk to lawyers. This is an evolving topic as the environment has been constantly changing and, of course, has become more complicated. Also included: a discussion on the recent Megaupload and other domain seizures, forced IP and search engine blocking, and a question and answer session on related matters."
  
  - title: "Make Your Laws: Practical Liquid Democracy"
    speakers: Sai
    desc: "This talk will include background on the concepts of direct, representative, and liquid democracies; the tradeoffs inherent in different types of government; interesting problems for online voting and policy authorship; examples of similar systems in different countries; discussion of some legal context (e.g. electronic signatures and the democratized use of Super PACs); a practical road map to gaining full control over your legislature; and Q&A. Make Your Laws (makeyourlaws.org) is an open source, nonprofit, practical project that aims to replace all existing legislatures with online liquid democracies. The aim is simple: to let you make your laws."
  
  - title: "Manufacturing Modern Computer Chips"
    speakers: QueueTard
    desc: "Modern computer chips are using transistors with features as small as 22nm. They are produced in factories that are 10,000 times cleaner than an operating room that can think like Skynet. Combined, the chips they produce run everything from your cell phone to the Internet itself. While outsiders might see it as the realm of multi-billion dollar corporations, in reality, it has been achieved through a hardcore application of the hacker mindset. Each new advancement involves hacking the theories of electrical engineering, hacking waves of light, and sometimes hacking physics. This talk will go over how and why the design of a modern nanoscale transistor was developed, as well as discuss the processes used to build them, and the incredible equipment that makes it all possible. Plus some fun stories about what goes wrong."
  
  - title: "Mastering Master-Keyed Systems"
    speakers: Deviant Ollam, Babak Javadi
    desc: "The world of locks is one in which, so very often, things old become new again. Master-keyed lock systems fall into this category. For years now, many people have shared advice and stories regarding methods of attacking master-keyed systems. This year, at HOPE Number Nine, The Open Organisation Of Lockpickers will be running a contest in which attendees may attempt to decode a master-keyed system during the weekend. If you stop by this presentation, you'll be a few steps ahead of everyone else who is attempting this interesting and different lockpicking game at HOPE Number Nine - and you'll learn about how master-keyed systems are often vulnerable to many surreptitious attacks."
  
  - title: "Messing with Nmap Through Smoke and Mirrors"
    speakers: Dan \"AltF4\" Petro
    desc: "Reconnaissance on a network has been an attacker's game for far too long. Where's the defense? Nmap routinely evades firewalls, traverses NATs, bypasses signature-based NIDS, and gathers up the details of your highly vulnerable box serving Top Secret documents. Why make it so easy? This talk will explore how to prevent network reconnaissance by using honeyd to flood your network with low fidelity honeypots. Dan will then discuss how this lets us constrain the problem of detecting reconnaissance such that a machine learning algorithm can be effectively applied. (No signatures!) Some important additions to honeyd will also be discussed along with a live demonstration of Nova, a free software tool for doing all of the above."
  
  - title: "\"No Natural Resources Were Hurt Assembling This Sofa\""
    speakers: Per Sjoborg
    desc: "This talk is an introduction and overview of a new and exciting field in robotics called Self Reconfiguring Modular Robotics (SRCMR). SRCMR is basically about modules, like Lego pieces, that can assemble themselves into anything you want (self reconfigure). You will hear how this makes a prosperous, growing, and environmentally friendly world accessible for all of us. This is possible because the stuff you need is assembled from the same modules, again and again, using no resources other than small amounts of energy. This drastically reduces the resources we use, and de-couples growth and environmental problems. Because the modules are programmable, SRCMR will also make the world completely hackable, introducing many interesting opportunities and challenges."
  
  - title: "Nymwars: Fighting for Anonymity and Pseudonymity on the Internet"
    speakers: Eva Galperin
    desc: "The last year has seen an Internet-wide debate over real names, pseudonyms, and anonymity online, especially on social networks and in the comment sections of blogs and newspapers. Facebook has required users to use their real names from the very beginning and newspapers have increasingly embraced the same requirement for commenting on their websites. Proponents of real name policies cite increased civility and quality of content. But pseudonymity and anonymity have a long history in public discourse, and they are essential for privacy and speaking truth to power. This talk will examine the debate over anonymity and pseudonymity online, with a focus on Facebook and the Arab Spring, and Google Plus and Nymwars."

  - title: "The Open Secure Telephony Network"
    speakers: Lee Azzarello, Mark Belinsky
    desc: "All of the necessary technologies and communications standards exist today for voice communications that are as secure as OpenPGP email. Both proprietary and open source solutions exist for desktop and mobile devices that implement the necessary bits to provide a solution without dependence upon one global service provider. ostel.me provides both a service and an application for the Android OS that is only marginally more complex to use than dialing an existing phone number, while still based entirely on open standards like SIP and ZRTP. The app is experimental and is based on existing open source client code provided by the CSipSimple, pjsip, and zrtp4pj projects."

    desc: "A look at some of the history of code breakers in the second World War. Bletchley Park in the United Kingdom was the home of the original WWII \"hackers\" and George will describe what goes on there today, as well as what Navy cryptologists managed to achieve during the war."
  
  - title: "Patents: How to Get Them and How to Beat Them"
    speakers: Ed Ryan
    desc: "Patents are a distasteful reality for hackers, open source programmers, and entrepreneurs alike. This talk aims to provide a working knowledge of how to read a patent, what is required to obtain patent protection, and how to defend yourself against patent lawsuits. This talk is an academic discussion of patent law and should not be construed as legal advice."
  
  - title: "Phone Phreak Confidential: The Backstory of the History of Phone Phreaking"
    speakers: Phil Lapsley
    desc: "Five years in the making, Phil has finally finished Phone Phreaks, his book on the history of phone phreaking from the 1950s to the 1980s. In this talk, he will weave together the evolution of phone phreaking with the backstory of the writing of his book. From giving John \"Cap'n Crunch\" Draper a piggyback ride around his apartment in order to secure an interview to cleaning out Joybubbles's apartment after his untimely demise, Phil's research took him through the maze of twisty little passages that wind through the history of this underground hobby. Some of the characters you'll meet include the phone phreak CEO of an electronic warfare company, a cell of Stony Brook students busted for blue boxing, and the mysterious and cantankerous head of the International Society of Telephone Enthusiasts. You'll also get a behind the scenes tour of the NSA and FBI's phone phreak files and the 400 Freedom of Information Act requests necessary to get them into the light of day."
  
  - title: "Practical Insecurity in Encrypted Radio"
    speakers: Sandy Clark, Matt Blaze, Travis Goodspeed
    desc: "APCO Project 25 (\"P25\") is a suite of wireless communications protocols used in the United States and elsewhere for public safety two-way (voice) radio systems. The protocols include security options in which voice and data traffic can be cryptographically protected from eavesdropping. This talk analyzes the security of P25 systems against passive and active adversaries. The panel found a number of protocol, implementation, and user interface weaknesses that routinely leak information to a passive eavesdropper or that permit highly efficient and difficult to detect active attacks. They found new \"selective subframe jamming\" attacks against P25, in which an active attacker with very modest resources can prevent specific kinds of traffic (such as encrypted messages) from being received, while emitting only a small fraction of the aggregate power of the legitimate transmitter. And, more significantly, they found that even passive attacks represent a serious immediate threat. In an over-the-air analysis conducted over a two year period in several U.S. metropolitan areas, they found that a significant fraction of the \"encrypted\" P25 tactical radio traffic sent by federal law enforcement surveillance operatives is actually sent in the clear - in spite of their users' belief that they are encrypted - and often reveals such sensitive data as the names of informants in criminal investigations.
  Aside from being important practical vulnerabilities in their own right, the problems in P25 secure radio represent an example of a class of problem that the security and cryptography community has largely ignored. Radio protocols typically do not fit the negotiated two-way communication model under which most security protocols are designed (and to which our community devotes most of its attention). One-way protocols, like P25, in which there is no negotiation or exchange between the transmitter and the receiver are actually rather unusual, and relatively little is known (or written in the literature) about robust design principles for them. In this talk, new approaches to protocol design will be suggested that might allow us to do better."
  
  - title: "Printable Electronics and the Future of Open Hardware"
    speakers: John Sarik
    desc: "Many open hardware projects use integrated circuits (ICs), but these ICs are literal black boxes because the manufacturers do not provide the silicon source code. There's also no way for makers to cost effectively modify and recompile this source code to fabricate custom ICs. But there is hope! Printable electronics based on novel materials and low cost fabrication techniques have the potential to enable open hardware at a whole new level. This talk will provide an overview of current printable electronics technology and discuss the issues that will arise as open hardware moves beyond silicon. What happens to open hardware when you can download and print an entire electronics project? How can we ensure that the materials used are open, widely available, and safe? How can we make IC design accessible to non-engineers? What should a Thingiverse for printable electronics look like? What are the legal issues surrounding printable electronics?"
  
  - title: "Privacy - A Postmortem (or Cell Phones, GPS, Drones, Persistent Dataveillance, Big Data, Smart Cameras and Facial Recognition, The Internet of Things, and Government Data Centers Vacuuming Google and Facebook, Oh My!)"
    speakers: Steven Rambam
    desc: "With a few keystrokes, it is now possible for an investigator to determine a target's location, activities, finances, sexual orientation, religion, politics, habits, hobbies, friends, family, their entire personal and professional histories... even accurately predict what they will do and where they will go in the future. Without leaving the office, a government agent can surveil a subject and \"watch\" their activities 24/7/365: where they drive, when they walk down the street, if they attend a church or synagogue or mosque or a demonstration or visit an abortion clinic or a \"known criminal activity location\" or meet with a \"targeted person\" or a disliked political activist. There is no longer any place to hide.
  Since the very first HOPE conference, private investigator extraordinaire Steven Rambam's lectures on privacy have kept attendees ten years ahead of the curve regarding surveillance technologies, investigative techniques, and the assaults upon personal privacy by government's Big Brothers and private industry's even bigger Big Sisters. His lectures described cell phone \"pinging\" eight years before it was used by the FBI and \"Google Glasses\" four years before they were announced. The past two years have seen the largest expansion of surveillance technologies ever and, in a wide ranging three hour lecture packed as always with dozens of real-world examples and case studies, Steven will provide a terrifying update on our absolute loss of privacy. His lecture is not for the weak of heart - or for those afraid of drones.

  - title: "Privacy by Design - a Dream for a Telecommunications Provider That Uses Strong Cryptography to Ensure Your Privacy"
    speakers: Nick Merrill
    desc: "This is a talk about launching a nonprofit organization that has some unique and disruptive ideas which challenge some of the basic assumptions about how modern communications systems work and that have the potential to transform the telecommunications and ISP industries with regards to privacy and freedom of expression. The seemingly dueling concerns of cybersecurity and privacy can both be addressed to some degree by the promotion of ubiquitous and opportunistic encryption, which would allow for an important political consensus between parties interested in either of those two issues. This topic and content is relevant to the hacker community and to HOPE attendees because of the implications of dragnet surveillance that has become commonplace in recent years, fueled in part by advances in technology and due to a shift towards more and more communication happening in the digital domain."
  
  - title: "Privacy Tricks for Activist Web Developers"
    speakers: Micah Lee
    desc: "Do you care about the privacy of your website's visitors, but also depend on social media to get your message out? Do you want to protect your visitors' anonymity in case you or a third party service you use gets subpoenaed? Do you want to be able to get meaningful and pretty analytics without third parties tracking your visitors? Can some kid in a coffee shop really hijack your users' accounts that easily?
  Chances are Google, Facebook, and Twitter know as much about your website's visitors as you do, IP addresses and user agents are sprinkled about your server's filesystem, Google Analytics is watching everyone's every move, and some kid in a coffee shop is already pwning your users. But it doesn't have to be this way! This technical talk will cover tricks that web developers and sysadmins can use to minimize the privacy problems that plague the modern web."

    speakers: The Doctor, Haxwithaxe, Sitwon
    desc: "Project Byzantium (a working group of HacDC) is proud to announce the release of Byzantium Linux, a live distribution which makes it fast and easy to build ad-hoc wireless mesh networks. Due to the actions of certain governments (such as those of Egypt, Tunisia, and Syria), alternative data networks are becoming more and more important as a means to communicate, organize, and coordinate. Project Byzantium aims to help support (and in some cases, replace) damaged or compromised Internet infrastructure and services with commodity wi-fi enabled equipment and a flexible, improvisable architecture. The presenters will discuss some of the engineering challenges faced and solutions that were developed to overcome them, including automatic network configuration and interaction with mobile clients that have limited capabilities."
  
  - title: "Protecting Your Data from the Cops"
    speakers: Marcia Hofmann
    desc: "What should you do if the police show up at your door to seize your computer? If they ask for passwords or passphrases, do you have to turn them over? Can they search your phone if they arrest you during a protest? What about when you're crossing the border? Your computer, phone, and other digital devices hold vast amounts of sensitive data that's worth protecting from prying eyes - including the government's. The Constitution protects you from unreasonable government searches and seizures, but how does this work in the real world? This talk with help you understand your rights when officers try to search the data stored on your digital devices, or keep it for further examination somewhere else. The constitutional protections that you have in these situations, and what their limits are will be discussed, along with technical measures you can take to protect the data on your devices."
  
  - title: "Pwn the Drones: A Survey of UAV Hacks and Exploits"
    speakers: Trevor Timm, Parker Higgins
    desc: "Drones are no longer a scary possible future of surveillance and remote force - they're here. Internationally, drones are being deployed for military action and observation. At home, police departments, border patrols, and others are acquiring UAVs and developing programs to fly them; there's even talk about adding \"less lethal\" arms to these domestic drones. Think Tasers and rubber bullets shot from the sky. But a series of alarming events over the past few years have demonstrated that many of these unmanned vehicles are dangerously vulnerable to exploits, leading to intercepted data, flight failures, and even remote takeovers. In this talk, Parker and Trevor will explain the privacy and security implications of some of the most sensational drone exploits and the weaknesses that enabled them. They'll also go over the work of communities and individuals that have been hacking drones from scratch, and what their efforts mean for our future understanding and regulation of drones."
  
  - title: "Real Advances in Android Malware"
    speakers: Jimmy Shah
    desc: "Attackers are starting to move on from simple attacks, mainly because users are beginning to figure out that the free adult entertainment or chat app shouldn't be sending SMS messages to expensive numbers. They're leveraging techniques from PC malware like server-side polymorphism, vulnerability exploits, botnets and network updates, and preemptive/direct attacks against security software. It's not all that bad. Attackers aren't going out of their way to discover their own vulnerabilities or writing their own exploits. They're happy to re-purpose the work done by legitimate developers, security researchers, and the rooting community. If the malware has gotten trickier, what are those tricks? A look at portions of code and how earlier research is adapted by attackers."
  
  - title: "Recent Advances in Single Packet Authorization"

This panel brings together these security researchers to discuss their findings, initial goals for doing the research, disclosure processes, and difficulties and surprises encountered. These researchers, independently and without corporate or \"nation state\" funding, decimated the popular belief that \"security via obscurity\" works to protect critical infrastructure."
  
  - title: "Sierra Zulu. Or How to Create a Feature Film About the Digital Age - and Why That's Pretty Hard"
    speakers: Johannes Grenzfurthner
    desc: "Movies are exciting. Things crash and burn. Bolts and fists fly. There are bangs and kabooms. People go to the cinemas in order to experience new worlds. But cinema is about to lose its prime source of narrative, having so far tethered to physical action that can be filmed. Cinema needs tempo. It needs speed. The \"movement-image\" (Gilles Deleuze) depends on physical action onto which the cameras can point. Yet, in contrast, the real world of non-cinema is losing physical action day by day. It is a time of abstract, optically unpresentable processes in networks and data systems. This regress of visual displayability is rather daft. Cinema has lived well on it for more than a hundred years. It's easy to create a feature film about a bank robbery, but that's anachronistic. Some of the most important crimes exist as electronic money movements between international stock exchanges. Hollywood cinema, on the other hand, still hasn't evolved beyond anything better than banal sequences straight out of an Errol Flynn movie. How can we accurately portray the stories of our (new) world? All those dramas and comedies? All those crimes and stories? The people at monochom are working on a feature film called Sierra Zulu. This talk will discuss their challenges and hopes - and why they think you can help."
  
  - title: "The Smartphone Penetration Testing Framework"
    speakers: Georgia Weidman
    desc: "As smartphones enter the workplace, sharing the network and accessing sensitive data, it is crucial to be able to assess the security posture of these devices in much the same way we perform penetration tests on workstations and servers. However, smartphones have unique attack vectors that are not currently covered by available industry tools. The smartphone penetration testing framework, the result of a DARPA Cyber Fast Track project, aims to provide an open source toolkit that addresses the many facets of assessing the security posture of these devices. This talk will look at the functionality of the framework including information gathering, exploitation, social engineering, and post exploitation through both a traditional IP network and through the mobile modem, showing how this framework can be leveraged by security teams and penetration testers to gain an understanding of the security posture of the smartphones in an organization. You will also learn how to use the framework through a command line console, a graphical user interface, and a smartphone-based app. Demonstrations of the framework assessing multiple smartphone platforms will be shown."

    speakers: Emmanuel Goldstein and friends
    desc: "Since the very first HOPE conference in 1994, the social engineering panel has been a huge draw. We basically round up a bunch of people who like to play on the phone, tell some stories, and make live calls to strangers who wind up telling us things they really shouldn't in front of a huge crowd of people who are trying very hard not to make any noise. It's all a lesson on how insecure information really is, and how you can avoid making the same mistakes that some unsuspecting person someplace will inevitably make when this panel randomly calls them.

  - title: "The State of HTTPS"
    speakers: Adam Langley
    desc: "Over the past couple of years, a flurry of developments and events have been happening in the world of HTTPS: from BEAST to HSTS to public key pinning and mixed scripting. Some of these are of abstract interest to technical users, and some require action on the part of webmasters. This talk will cover the broad brush strokes of these developments with a focus on how webmasters can take advantage of them and how to avoid silly configuration mistakes. In the latter part of the talk, a few expected future developments will be covered."
  
  - title: "The State of Open Source Hardware"
    speakers: Dustyn Roberts, Catarina Mota
    desc: "In the last few years, open source hardware went from an obscure hobby to a burgeoning movement built on values and practices derived from open source software, hacker culture, and craft traditions. This increase is visible in the exponential growth of the community of developers and users, the increase in the number and revenue of open source hardware businesses, and the emergence of a large number of new DIY gadgets and machinery - from 3D printers and microcontrollers to soft circuits and tech crafts. The accessibility of hardware plans, along with the communities and collaborative practices that surround them, is lowering the barrier to entry and encouraging people of all ages and walks of life to create, hack, and re-purpose hardware. Taken together, hackerspaces, the increasing accessibility of digital fabricators, and these open and collaborative practices are leading to an explosion of creativity and innovation reminiscent of the golden years of the Homebrew Computer Club. This panel will go over the defining events of the last few years to draw a snapshot of the current state of the open source hardware movement and the impact it's having in hacker culture and beyond. Also included in the discussion will be the Open Hardware Summit: the world's first comprehensive conference on open hardware, and how it will serve as a venue to discuss and draw attention to the rapidly growing open source hardware movement."

    speakers: Da Beave (Champ Clark III)
    desc: "In protecting today's network infrastructures, organizations have a lot of shiny tools at their disposal. Firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, network-based ACLs, two factor authentication, and much more. While these are great tools for detection and prevention of network intrusions, system and network logs are often overlooked. This talk will discuss using a fairly new open source (GNU/GPLv2) utility known as \"Sagan\" for real time log analysis."
  
  - title: "Technology to Change Society: What Not to Do"
    speakers: Chris Anderson, Gus Andrews, Matt Curinga, Christina Dunbar-Hester
    desc: "Many of us in the hacker/maker communities have a powerful desire to change society by sharing the technologies we're passionate about with those around us. We're convinced that our way of thinking can lead people to liberation, empowerment, and better lives. But it doesn't always work the way we hope. While some technologies support change in certain situations - Twitter and mobile devices in the Middle East and Africa, the printing press and democracy - history is littered with failed technology-driven plans to change the world. This is where programmers can take a page from social research and history. There is not, in fact, consensus in the research that \"technology teaches itself\" or \"code is law.\" Society is a complex system (people are complex systems!) and overly simplistic beliefs that technology has one universal kind of impact on its users can doom well-intentioned efforts to help others use technology. What do we need to know about society and how technology changes it in order to be successful?
  In this panel, Gus will share some basic rules from research on education, political movements, and social change which everyone who wants to write code to change the world should know. Christina will share cases of activist technical interventions that illustrate the complexity of success or failure, and how inseparable social and technical elements can be. Chris will do a postmortem of some past projects to change journalism with technology, including the Independent Media Center, discussing their successes and failures. And Matt will talk about his work to develop a degree in open technology and education at Adelphi University: what he's doing to convince administrators that FOSS technology is important enough to merit its own program, what challenges he faces in talking to educators, and the things in his plan of study which he thinks are most important for politically conscious tech developers to know."

    speakers: Ben Combee
    desc: "In this talk, Ben will show how to use tools already included in the popular web browsers Firefox and Chrome to learn what's really happening when you browse the web. He'll show how to find hidden values in forms, watch AJAX transactions, and manipulate the data you send out into the cloud, as well as touch on extensions like AdBlock and Greasemonkey and see how they can automate much of this for you."
  
  - title: "The Weather is Not Boring! Forecasting, Following, and Photographing Storms"
    speakers: John Huntington
    desc: "In recent years, real time weather data and numerical forecast model information has moved from proprietary systems and closed distribution methods to the Internet, and huge amounts of taxpayer-funded weather data in easy to understand formats is now free for all to use. This has made it easier than ever for anyone to get a good forecast anytime and anywhere, while also allowing storm chasers to leverage their meteorologic knowledge and use mobile Internet technologies and GPS location tracking to chase tornadoes, hurricanes, lightning, and other severe weather. The presentation will give an overview of weather data gathering methodologies, from ground stations and radar to satellites and weather balloons; give an overview of free or cheap web resources and forecasting models; explain the difference between a \"watch\" and a \"warning;\" and show some results from both urban and rural storm chasing."
  
  - title: "We Will Be Legion: Decentralizing the Web"
    speakers: Deb Nicholson
    desc: "The popularity of massive centralized services presents challenges for collective privacy, a full diversity of viewpoints, and customized online identities. Decentralized or federated services are gaining popularity as the answer for users concerned about the one-size-fits-all web. There is significant work to be done on both the technical and social aspects of federation. Deb will discuss current alternatives, near to ready projects, and the ones we might want to start thinking about building."
  
  - title: "When the Founder is Gone: Longevity for Open Projects"
    speakers: Greg Newby
    desc: "A single visionary is often credited with shaping innovation and leading to success in open source and open content projects. This success doesn't come from that person alone: he or she leads a corps of willing volunteers, admirers, workers, and others who will turn vision into reality - often with some sort of organizational structure, and across a span of years. This presentation will focus on how to maintain the health and sustainability of such organizations with strong well-known leaders in the event the founder is lost. The presenter will draw upon personal experience with the recent loss of Michael Hart, founder of Project Gutenberg and inventor of eBooks. Every organization is different, and every leader is different. Yet, there are many common characteristics in efforts that started with a single visionary, who led formation of what became a large and successful organization. The presentation will point out some of these similarities and identify some of the promising strategies that have been effective for continuity."
  
  - title: "Why Browser Cryptography is Bad and How We Can Make It Great"
    speakers: Nadim Kobeissi
    desc: "Web apps are becoming almost exponentially responsible for handling user data. This incredible increase summons an urgent requirement for client-side web browser crypto standards. However, web browsers lack client-side crypto standards for building blocks such as secure block ciphers, public key schemes, and hashing algorithms. Developers currently rely on JavaScript crypto libraries in order to implement these functions, which can, admittedly, provide strong crypto in some situations, but still falter when faced with certain attacks. This talk will look at Cryptocat, a security-centric web-chat client with client-side cryptography, and also focus on the problems, the solutions, and the limitations of JavaScript cryptography. There will be a discussion of potential solutions to these problems, which may very well require the implementation of an integrated universal web browser standard for client-side cryptography."
  
  - title: "Why Names Matter: How Online Identity is Defining the Future of the Internet"
    speakers: aestetix
    desc: "As the Internet becomes more public and universal, the world is beginning to have an identity crisis. Some big questions are coming up: who are we, and how should we be represented online? Originally inspired by having his Google Plus account suspended twice during the nymwars fiasco, aestetix will explore the deeper nature of how we identify ourselves and each other. The talk will look at issues both from a technology and social perspective, asking questions like why hacker handles are important, and how our notions of privacy have changed in the greater scheme. It will also cover the ways in which current online social networks try to build upon existing social relationships and discuss suggestions for improvement in the future."
  
  - title: "Why You Shouldn't Write Off Higher Education, Young Grasshopper"
    speakers: John Linwood Griffin
    desc: "This talk is addressed to that kid in the back who's wearing a Utilikilt and a black t-shirt that says \"I Hack Charities,\" who asks, \"Why would I bother going to grad school? I'm self-taught, college was a waste of my time, and universities only exist to train wage slaves.\" John will draw from personal experience to describe how in graduate school you get to do what you love, you get to make larger and more structured contributions to the community, you experience personal growth while surrounded by amazing people, you're part of a meritocracy and a close-knit social circle, and the door is open for interesting opportunities afterward. Included will be a discussion on how hackers can get in."

  - title: "Your Cell Phone is Covered in Spiders! (An Overview of Mobile Device Security)"
    speakers: Cooper Quintin
    desc: "Smartphones have changed the world. Your calendar, photographs, private documents, and communication with your entire social sphere is now just a swipe away. We are carrying exponentially increasing amounts of highly personal data around with us in our pockets. But are we doing enough to safeguard this data? Mobile devices are also becoming an important tool for social change, but with this they also become a more important target for governments and corporations. With so many attack vectors on mobile devices, it is important to know the ways that your mobile device can be compromised and how you can protect against these attacks. This talk will focus primarily on the security of the Android operating system. You will hear about how to protect your phone against warrantless search and seizure by law enforcement, as well as how much damage malicious apps can actually do and how to protect yourself from becoming the victim of malware. You will hear about password security concerns on Android and how to protect yourself, along with some of the many great security-related apps that Android has to offer. This talk will examine the question of whether you can protect yourself from the greatest of all threats to your phone: The Phone Company."
