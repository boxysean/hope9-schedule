This is a rough attempt to lay out the HOPE 9 talks.

Check out the hope9.yaml file to see what information it holds. Most of the talk titles and schedule titles are the same (with a couple of exceptions!)

Required to run schedule.py: pyyaml 3.10

TODO
====

- Populate the speaker information into the YAML
- Umm make it look nicer
